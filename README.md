# okta-auth-code-pkce
JS only sample for usign Authorization Code Flow with PKCE with Okta.

To use this small script make sure to change the baseUrl, client_id and redirect_uri variables as needed in the auth.js file. By default, the redirect_uri will be set to **window.location.origin**

This should be treated as is. Okta does not offer any liability / support for this flow. This sample should be used as a POC and can be copied / cloned and used as needed.
